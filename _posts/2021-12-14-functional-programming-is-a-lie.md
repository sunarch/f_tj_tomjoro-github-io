As more computer languages adopt functional constructs it seems *pure* functional languages have been pushed into a corner. Many developers are familar with closures in Javascript, and they are now available in Java, C++, etc., but *pure* functional languages are a bit different - they are stricter in the definition of "functional". If functional is good, why aren't pure functional languages like Haskell, OCaml, etc. used more widely?

Some developers claim *pure* functional languages aren't practical, i.e. they are too strict and they don't reflect the "real" (reality) world of computers because real computers have mutable state, and so trying to program without mutable state is just a mathematical exercise (and also hard for software developers). What's reality got to do with programming languages?

Why choose a *pure* or *impure* functional language? And are there really only 2 choices? Either we reject mutability and program in a pure functional language, or we just accept mutable reality and join the impure crowd? 

I've thought about this question since I started using Elixir (5 years now), when trying to build a mental framework for categorizing languages.

# Pure Functional Languages 

 "Testing can show the presence of bugs but not their absence" - Dijkstra.

In the early days of computer science, a lot of work was done to try to use math to prove program correctness. Think about that - it would mean that when you delivered your program to a customer you could say "this is provably correct so there cannot be any bugs by definition", unlike today when we say "it has 80% test coverage and worked when I tried it" ;) 

There's no exact definition of fuctionally pure purity, but generally it's these things:
* Immutable state / data, 
* No side-effects 
* First class functions (functions can treated as data)
* etc. 

Javascript is a functional language. Why isn't it a *pure* functional language? 

* Javascript fails purity because it allows for mutation of state and side effects - most mainstream language fail for this same reason: Java, Go, C#, Rust, Python, Ruby, etc. 
* Rust fails pureity because it has unsafe modes and allow side effects
* Erlang and Elixir fail this test because they allow side effects

What is immutable data and what is a side effect?

## Functional Constructs 

### Mutation 
I put 99 beers on the shelf. The shelf now has 99 beers. Hence, the real world has state. I take one down, and drink it, and now the shelf has 98 beers (and so on). The shelf has state has changed from 99 to 98 beers, i.e. mutated. The shelf is like a memory location in a computer and the count of beers is the value stored there.

Pure functional languages don't allow mutation. In our beer analogy, the shelf with 99 beers can never be anything else. If you want a shelf with 98 beers, you'll need a _new_ shelf because the shelf with 99 beers _cannot_  changed (i.e. mutate). Sounds wasteful! In pure functional languages beers don't just disappear - there's a reason (very useful!). 

Does the real world have mutable state? Certainly seems like the mutable state matches our _view_ of the world better and I can't argue with that -- this is the "pure functional programming is a lie"...

### Diagram

Making this discussion as simple as I can: 

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/blog_function.png)

* A function takes inputs and computes an output

In this drawing, x had an assigned value of 25 and after calling f(x) the output was 5. Possibly this function computes the square root, but we can't know because it's a black box. 

* In a pure functional language, x being 25 will always give 5 as an output. (in fact the whole thing can be substituted for the output)
* In a impure functional language, i.e. one that allows side effects, sometimes when I put 25 in, the output might be 5 and maybe other times it comes out as 3.1415. This is called a having _side effects_. (for example getTime() will always yeild a different result)
* In a impure functional language that allows *mutation* sometimes 25 comes out 5 or 3.1415 and sometimes *x* might _somewhat magically change to some new value like 52_.

Of these three cases, *mutation* is the hardest one to understand and compose because the black box can no longer be treated as a black box - it can affect the world outside the box (the magical change of x). We must look into the black box to understand what it did to x (or to see if it might change x).

# Programming Language Classifications

Take a look at this list:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Pure

The list of functional languages has only two categories: *Pure* and *Impure*.

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/languages.png)

The list of "Functional Languages", or languages that have functional constructs is very long nowadays! However, the list of *pure* functional languages is a lot shorter, e.g. Haskell, Ocaml, etc.

Where is the category: _Languages with immutable data_? Is mutation/immutable just a minor detail? ! ? I even tried searching Stack Overflow - "Computer Languages with Only Immutability". Seems most developers answers misunderstood the question, __or fail to believe it is possible to understand that there even is such a category__. 

There are at least a couple of widely used languages that have immutability _only_. _The key word here is the word "only", which means "there is no unsafe mode, there is only immutable"._
* Haskell
* Erlang / Elixir

Here's some drawings I made that focuses on only Pure and Impure as defined by 1) Purity (no side effects), and 2) Mutable (or immutable) data:

## Pure and Impure
This is the categorization on Wikipedia:
* "Pure" = No side effects, and "Impure" = side effects
* "Immutable" = No mutation of data, "Mutate" = allows mutation of data

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/pure_impure.png)

But where is Erlang and Elixir in this drawing???

## Elixir and Erlang 

Elixir and Erlang are impure, yet they do have immutable (only) data. You get an interesting cross category here:

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/erlang_middle.png)

Erlang and Elixir: Impure, yet Immutable.

Here's what the list of functional languages should look like:
* Pure functional languages with immutable data
* Impure functional languages with immutable data
* Functional languages

## But "Mutation is a reality, the correct approach is disciplined mutation"

 I can hear a thousand developer's voices calling out that: Yes, but Rust, Clojure, etc., have immutable data constructs and that if you just keep your mutations in a box then you're ok.
 
"Mutation is a reality, the correct approach is disciplined mutation. "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18044656

Mutation is like a virus and has severe consequences in a language: if you allow any possibility to mutate data in any way (like "unsafe" mode) then the language looses the ability to provide certain guarantees as we will see in the next sections (and add threads to mutation and you have a recipe for nondeterminism) - https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-1.pdf

The main issue here is that language designers often try to solve _all problems_ with a single language. Erlang and Elixir have a different answer: __If you need mutation use another language__.  Seriously, that's not that different from "box mutation in unsafe mode" - it's just that the boxing has to be absolutely solid. Also, the justification for having mutability is often for _performance_ reasons, and that performance gained by using mutation is dimished when you consider highly parallel and concurrent systems (which is pretty much everything nowadays). https://tomjoro.github.io/2017-01-31-world-changed/

# The Real World

Immutability - certainly Computer Science (everything is expressible with recursion) and math have it as a central concept, but what about the real world of computers?

Are computers just _state machines_ that represent computation through _global state_ changes?  https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-you-don-t-like-about-Functional-Programming/answer/Jussi-Raunio?ch=10&share=4a170b91&srid=lM1b

Real computers:
* indeed have mutable memory,
* have global state, well sort of - computers are connected to networks, have multiple cores, caches, I/O, GPU, etc. so how can global state exist?

It really seems that the real world has mutation. 

Until I realized what was missing from the comparison.

## Time

__We forgot to consider _time_ in our world view - and time does exist!__

__The real world is actually immutable.__

The real world is immutable when viewed at any point in time
* the past canâ€™t be changed 
* state is only definable by observation (at a time)

State arises from recursion in time. 

There is nothing strange about defining state this way, in fact most computer memories work exactly this way: you can see this recursion _at the level of the logic circuits that implement computer memory_ 

Here's a logic diagram of a flip-flop. A flip flop is a 1 bit computer memory and is how RAM is built in a _real_ computer.

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/flipflop.png)

You don't have to understand this diagram, but notice how the lines feedback on themselves. Once you set the state on one of the lines, it recurses holding that state until the state until it is changed. And original computer memories were things like mercury delay lines, even CRTs, as recursed and repeatedly played back a signal put into them. In the past this was more apparent, but now this recursion is hidden in logic circuits.

The fact that time is real has further implications. 

## Distribution - Global State is a Lie

If time is real then it also prevents us from knowing the state of the entire world at any point in time. We can't have a global state, but we know our a local state within some reference (a world).


What does this picture look like: 

![Elixir]({{ site.url }}/img/worlds.png)

This is where side effects come from - things changes outside our local reference even though state might be immutable inside a "world".

So, even though each world internally uses immutable state, if viewed from the outside, i.e. observed, then it has state. This is one of things that confuses people about Elixir - it seems there is state everywhere, but at the same time data is immutable!

In the Erlang/Elixir these independent "worlds" that each have their own local and immutable state are *processes*. Processes have observable state, which can be seen by sending a message to the process and asking it, and then the process sending you a response. Each process is a consistent world unto itself and has nothing shared with other processes.

This also matches the real world - state must be communicated to be known. _This is especially true nowadays as computing has become increasingly distributed and parallel even on a small scale._ https://tomjoro.github.io/2017-01-31-world-changed/

Process and the share-nothing approach has great benefits:
* Fail without interfering with other processes
* Cleanly terminated (from the outside) 
* Take care of their own garbage
* etc.

In Elixir, individual processes can fail, self-destruct, or be killed, but the system as a whole can continue to run (guaranteed). 

# Is Pure Functional Programming a Lie?

Back to the original question: Is pure functional programming a lie? Saying pure functional programming is a lie is like saying math is a lie. It's not a lie, but it doesn't always map well to the real world of computers -  but that's not because of immutability, but instead stems from not taking *time* and *distribution* into account. 

# Elixir's Category 

There is some middle ground, a category, between *pure-functional languages* and *impure functional languages* -- and that middleground is a category that Elixir owns and I belive this is one factor that drives the continued growth of Elixir. Elixir is not a "solve all problems" language, but it does work efficiently in more situations that many developers thought possible.

Giving this category a name is difficult: is it "impure functional with distributed and immutable state" or "functional, dynamic, safe language", or ?. How about a "Reliable Language"?

_How is reliability defined? Reliable computing is correct functioning even if individual hardware or software components fail for any reason. The definition also includes secure computing which is about intentional attaks on your system._

Erlang (and hence Elixir) and the BEAM virtual machine that it runs on, first and foremost goal is to be reliable. Every decision about the language (and BEAM execution environment) as it evolved has prioritized having reliability as the most important criteria. 
* Immutable data is safer, especially in a concurrent environment
* Processes make writing code with immutable data more practical and simple  - (https://tomjoro.github.io/2021-12-30-elixir-doesnt-look-very-functional/)

Prioritizing reliability actually works in practice: Elixir it is consistently fast (not the fastest), extremely fair, quite versatile (not the most versatile), scalable, easy to undestand and develop with, and most importantly reliable. 

# Disclaimer

Haskell is useful, Go is nice, I love Ruby, C++ is efficient, C# is handy, Java is solid, Rust makes sense, etc. - I've been programming for over 40 years and it's not my intention to bash on other languages - comparisons that evoke emotions promote thinking and discussion :) and so happy coding!
